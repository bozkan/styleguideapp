    <h1 class="h4" style="margin-bottom:1rem;">You need to create a style guide and pattern library, but you're not sure how to go about doing it.</h1>
    <p>Github pages would work, but you want it done instantly. You could host your own style guides, but this has additional costs, and takes time to set up each project.</p>
    <p>Both of those options suck because they involve re-using a template, which means making updates would be time-consuming.</p>
    <p>The existing solutions charge an arm and a leg just for one brand.</p>
    <p>So I built <span class="color-neutral-6">StyleGuides.app</span>.</p>
    <p>Easily generate color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems. Keep track of all of your components, along with their markup and styles.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:2rem;">Keep the whole team on the same page, and maintain brand consistency by having a rock-solid system to reference.</p>
