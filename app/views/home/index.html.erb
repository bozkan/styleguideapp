    <h1 class="h4" style="margin-bottom:1rem;">You need to create a style guide and pattern library, but you're not sure how to go about doing it.</h1>
    <p>Maybe you could re-use a template, but it would be time-consuming to make changes to all of them. You also have to find a place to host them, which has additional costs.</p>
    <p>The existing solutions charge an arm and a leg just to maintain a style guide for one brand.</p>
    <p>So I built <span class="color-neutral-6">StyleGuides.app</span>.</p>
    <p>Easily generate color palettes, typography scales, and spacing systems. Keep track of all of your components, along with their markup and styles.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom:2rem;">Keep your team on the same page, and improve consistency in your projects UI's by having a rock-solid system to reference.</p>
