<h1 class="h3 mb-4">Style Guide</h1>
<div class="w-75">
<p>As <%= current_tenant.name %> continues to grow, both as a product and a company, one challenge we are faced with is learning how to refine the <%= current_tenant.name %> brand identity and apply it cohesively to each of our products.</p>
<p>We created this styleguide to act as a central location where we house a live inventory of UI components, brand guidelines, brand assets, code snippets, developer guidelines and more.</p>
<p>Anyone working on the <%= current_tenant.name %> product is encouraged to stay familiar with this styleguide and help ensure that it is kept up-to-date.</p>
